              Boasting a rich royal heritage that is reinstated by the many
              monuments that dot its premises, Mysuru is nestled at the
              foothills of the picturesque Chamundi Hill in Karnataka. The city
              is a melange of the old and the new, its small-town charm well
              preserved in its palaces and well-laid out gardens. It also holds
              spirituality close to its heart that is evident from the various
              temples, churches and mosques here. Popularly called the Ivory
              city as most of its buildings are painted in ivory colour, it is
              an ideal destination for the modern-day traveller â€“ it has
              excellent infrastructure and plenty of options for accommodation
              options ranging from the modest to the luxurious, and it offers an
              abundance of places of historical and natural significance. It
              also has a host of eateries that serve delicious South Indian
              fares.
